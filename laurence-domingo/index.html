<h5>Dreamer. Believer. Achiever.</h5>
<p> I am a Grade 10 student based in the Philippines. In the 11 years of Schooling, I have learned that the biggest journey comes from a single step. When you have a dream or ambition and its so far away or its so high up, you could feel overwhelmed. But when you look at it just one step out of a time, one day you would up to your feet and you would be at your destination. </p>
<p> Currently, I am doing my best so that I could reach another milestone in my life. </p>
